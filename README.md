# datastructure-performance-delta
A small script and notebook to check the performance of some data structure sorts done on quantum random numbers

## Instructions

1. Download **perf_script.py** script and execute it.
2. Test results will be reported as a plain text file available at the same directory on which the script was run.

Alternatively, you can use the "Run in Colab Button".
